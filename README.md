# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Project Overview
An entrepeneur is looking to open a Surf Shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. As an investing partner, analysis of the weather is key to understanding the viability of this adventure. Initially, the core work required analysis of the average percipitation by reporting station as well as temperature from a particular location on the island. The final challenge only looked at temperature for two months: June and December.

 
## Project Resources
Analysis of a SQLite database was done using Python through Jupyter Notebook.


## Analysis Results
The database was parsed to allow analysis of the summary statistics for the months of June and December contained in the dataset.
The summary temperature statistics for June are shown below:

The summary temperature statistics for December are shown here:

There are small but significant differences in temperature between June and December for the island of Oahu:

- The average temperature in June is 3 degrees warmer than December.
- The maximum temperature is higher in June while the minimum temperature in December is lower.
- The spread of temperatures means there is more variation in temperature in June than in December.

## Summary
This narrow analysis shows us that temperatures have very little change from the summer to winter seasons on the island of Oahu. However, there is more information needed to make an important investment decision. As a partner, I would want to know the average percipitation between these two months as well as which reporting station provided the weather conditions most condusive to surfing. This could show us that location of our new surf shop should be on the east side of the island versus the west. I would need more information than just summary temperature statistics to make an informed decision about this investment.
